# Windows native libraries
Here is a list of libraries implemented in C++ and compiled as a Windows native dll.

These libraries can be used in a variety of programming languages, but always for software to run on Windows
Depending on the functionality implemented there are two libraries

## iID速 driver engine
For communication with RFID reader

* Sample codes
    * [samples-doc_transponders_windows](https://github.com/Micro-Sensys/samples-doc_transponders_windows) *native* folder
    * [samples-doc_telidtransponders_windows](https://github.com/Micro-Sensys/samples-doc_telidtransponders_windows) *native* folder

## TELID3xx Native
For interacting (read, programm, ...) TELID速300 data loggers (currently supported TELID速311 and TELID速343)
* [API Documentation](https://www.microsensys.de/downloads/DevSamples/Libraries/Windows/TELID300%20-%20native%20library/APIDoc_TELID3xx_native_driver_TP_16_E.pdf)

* Sample codes
    * [samples-doc_telidloggers_windows](https://github.com/Micro-Sensys/samples-doc_telidloggers_windows)

## Integration steps
For Windows native libraries, they should just be accessible to your software at runtime. You should add the function definitions in your code to be load dynamically.

There are some ways to achieve this. Some examples:
* Add them in the folder where the final EXE is located. This should be enough for Windows to be able to find it and access it
* Install it in the computer in one of the *default* location for DLLs (for example *Windows* folder)
