# TELID® - RFID sensor transponders and loggers
TELID® product line are combine sensors and RFID technology. The result is wireless identification with sensor measurements.

We currenlty offer passive RFID sensor transponders and semi-passive RFID sensor data loggers. Main differences:
* Sensor transponder
    * no battery included (passive)
    * measurement of current value when RFID reader is in reading distance
    * [see further details](sensor-transponder)
* Sensor data loggers
    * battery included but only for logging purposes, RFID communication is still passive (semi-passive)
    * RTC included
    * measurement of values and internal storage
    * readout of logged data via RFID
    * [see further details](sensor-data-logger)
